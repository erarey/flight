<p>Really? You wondered about the legality of rocket
  propelled gliders? Well thank you for your interest.
  But honestly... it's just a bad idea, legal or not.</p>

  <p>Just to recap: Your shoes would catch on fire, or
  the glider itself, and when you hit the ground, you'll
probably explode, gruesomely. So just don't do it.</p>
